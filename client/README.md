## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or locally installed MongoDB)
- Firebase project setup for OAuth authentication

### Steps

1. *Clone the repository*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhairya-A-Mehra/FCC-Project-24.git
   cd blog-platform-ai
   

2. *Install dependencies for the server and client*

   bash
   # Server
   cd server
   npm install

   # Client
   cd ../client
   npm install
   

3. *Set up environment variables*

   Create .env files in both server and client directories (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

4. *Run the application*

   bash
   # In the server directory
   npm run dev

   # In the client directory
   npm start
   

5. *Visit the application*

   Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (client) and http://localhost:3000 (server).

## Environment Variables

### Server .env


PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
AI_API_KEY=your_openai_or_gemini_api_key


### Client .env


REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_AI_API_KEY=your_openai_or_gemini_api_key
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5173


## Scripts

### Client Scripts

- npm start: Runs the React app in development mode.
- npm run build: Builds the React app for production.

### Server Scripts

- npm run dev: Runs the Node.js server with hot-reloading using Nodemon.
- npm start: Runs the server in production mode.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. *State Management and Persisting Authentication*  
   Used Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist to manage and persist user authentication states across sessions.

2. *Schema Design and Query Optimization*  
   Optimized MongoDB schema with embedded comments for efficient query performance and applied indexing on post content fields.

3. *API Rate Limits for AI Integration*  
   Cached frequent API responses and used debounce functions to limit API calls, reducing excessive calls during typing.

4. *Deployment Compatibility*  
   Resolved environment variable issues and adjusted configurations to ensure compatibility on Render.

5. *Role-Based Access Control*  
   Added middleware to handle role-based access for users and admins, ensuring secure and restricted access to sensitive admin features.
